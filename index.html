            <p>Even though StFX is a university deeply rooted in tradition, we are committed to moving forward when the occasion demands it and now is the time for us to plunge into the digital age.As you'll read in our piece about the greening of StFX, we all play a role in reducing emissions and waste, and we pledge to use as little paper as possible in the coming years.</p>

                <p>Shifting into a digital format also gives us the freedom to brings our stories to life in a way that’s just not possible in 2D. We hope you enjoy learning about the people who loaned their names and their legacies to cameron and MacKinnon Halls,s as we embark on a campaign to reinvent the way we think about residence living at university <br> <br> <br>You'll notice, too, that we're more focused on the impact side of things and was less on the donor. We want you to understand not just see how much your support means to the students , faculty and staff of StFX your contributions touch every facet of the university, from athletics to the new institute for innovation in Health slated to begin construction next year. <br> <br><br>We hope you'll be as excited as we  are to learn about just a few of the projects that our students are working on, from a lifejacket that could revolutionize the labster</p>

    <p>The federal government will pay for your education, so you enroll at StFX. You look forward to the pastoral setting, only to quickly realize that there are many, many people who've had the same idea. The university doesn't have enough dormitory space to house you, or faculty members to teach you. Rooms that were meant for two have another bed squeezed in, and the basement of the university's only dormitory-MocklerHall- is converted into living quarters.A temporary military building is brought yo campus; married students live there.  <br> <br> <br> Ats StFX, this is a story with echoes of the past. In 1900,100 students attended StFX. They lived and studied in Xavier Hall alongside the faculty. By 1914, there were 218 students- and Xavier Hall could no longer house them all. Mockler Hall was a built in 1915, to "provide clean, bright and airy rooms for the majority of the University students and professors." The students' suites were well-appointed, and included bricks fire place but the building's main attraction was indoor plumbing.</p>
    <h3 class="fade-in-text"> <span>By 1945,</span> with the addition of the veterans,more than 500 students were clamoring for space in residence. StFX brought in New England architect Jens Larson, Who'd also designed Morrison Hall, to create a 200  person residence out of local sandstone, in the Georgina Colonial style -Cameron Hall</h3>

        <p>In 1894, the entirety of StFX was contained within Xavier Hall,  and the students were taught by faculty-priestsThe college was severely lacking in creature comforts, and so the Bishop of Antigonish 
            appealed to the Sisters of Charity, a Catholic congregation in Halifax. </p>

    <div class="wellspring-content">

            <p>He proposed that the Sisters of Charity recruit young nuns from the Diocese of Antigonish, who could procide domestic
                services at StFX.<br> <br>
                
                The first thirteen Sisters of the newly-formed auxiliary order the Sisters of Saint Martha arrived in Antigonish that summer and got to
                work. They did laundry, cleaned the students rooms as well as the priests offices and classrooms, and nursed sick young men in the
                infirmary. More than that, they made the college feel like a home.<br> <br>
                
                From StFx, the Marthas expanded into nursing and were instrumental in the establishment of many hospitals in northeastern
                Nova Scotia in the first half of the twentieth century.</p>

                spent the summer after his first year at StFX on the wharves of east- ern Prince Edward Island, div- ing underneath the hulls of lobster boats and cutting tan- gled ropes free from the pro- pellers.</span></h6>
            <p>﻿
                It's one in a long line of jobs he's had that other young people seem reluctant to do, but he liked the wharfside chats - and the cash. He noticed, though, that very few of the fishers wore lifejack- ets. Men (and some women) who are third-and fourth-generation fishers, he notes, "didn't grow up wearing them," despite being all too aware of the myriad dangers of a life on the sea. There's stigma around wearing lifejackets, and in an ancient trade known for its superstitions, wearing a lifejacket can often be seen as inviting bad luck - as though you're expecting something bad to happen.<br> <br>
                What if, Ben thought, he could design a lifejack- et that could be encompassed within the fishers' existing oil gear, so integrated that it'd be almost undetectable? And what if he could include a GPS locator beacon within the device?</p>

        <h6>At any given home game at StFX,<span> ﻿
            ﻿
 you can count on seeing more than a few
familiar faces in the
bleachers.</span></h6>
        <p>﻿There's Father Stan, decked out in blue and white, and Antigonishers of all ages who come to cheer on the X-Men and X-Women. And there's Kar- en Gardiner '89, a member of the StFX Board of Governors and Co-Chair of Women of X-cellence, which supports the X-Women.<br> <br>
            Her office - she's a partner at McInnes Cooper in Halifax - is decorated with StFX memorabilia: a football helmet. A signed Henoc Muamba jersey. A rugby ball signed by a national champion team of X-Women. A Coach K bobble hat. A piece of the old floor from the Oland Centre.?</p>
